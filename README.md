It's just a sample and idea how you can create docx temp to pdf and using. most of the code has been copied from other places but still good example to have to remind me something in future.


## RUN AND TEST

clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/h-rafiee/docx-temp-to-pdf.git
```

create some virtual env for you in python3

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```
and activate it

```sh
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

now install libs

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then feel free to run code

```sh
python run.py
```
